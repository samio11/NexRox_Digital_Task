Role-based access control (only job owners can update/delete their jobs).
Password hashing with bcrypt for security.
Error handling for invalid requests, unauthorized access, and resource not found.

Technologies

Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
Express: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
TypeScript: Type-safe JavaScript superset.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user and job data.
Mongoose: ODM for MongoDB.
Bcrypt: Password hashing library.
JSON Web Tokens (JWT): For secure user authentication.
Zod: For request validation (if applicable).

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/job-board-api.git
cd job-board-api

Install dependencies:
npm install

Set up environment variables:Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
BCRYPT_SALT=10
